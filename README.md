# AccountSwitcher
Switch between multiple accounts

## Warning
_**User tokens can be used for using someone else's account without their knowledge.
To prevent token abuse BetterDiscord staff is not supporting account switchers. If something isn't working ask me and not in BetterDiscord support servers.<br>
Also you shouldn't give your token to anybody. If you do they can access your account and can do everything you don't need a verification with the password.<br>
If you accidentally shared your token you can change your password or enable 2FA and you will get a new token. But don't forget to change the token in your settings.**_

## Usage
### Adding accounts
You can add up to 10 accounts. Therefore you need to go to the plugin settings and add the accounts you want.<br>
There are 10 rows with two input fields each. The left input is just for you so you know which account that is.
You can write whatever you want in that field.<br>
The right input is for the account token. Probably you don't know how to get the token so I added a button at the bottom of the settings that copies the token into your clipboard.
Just paste the token into the input and you are ready to switch to that account.<br>
**If you change your password or you enable/disable 2FA your account gets a new token. The old one will no longer be working.**

### Switching accounts
To switch between account you only need to press the `AltLeft` key and a number key (NOT NUMPAD!). With `1` you will switch to the account labeled as `Account 1` in the settings. `2` is `Account 2` etc. `0` is `Account 10`.

You can also middle click your avatar in the quick settings field at the bottom. A popup will appear with the accounts you have set in the settings (and their avatar, but for some people it doesn't seem to work). Just click the account you want to switch to and everything should work fine.
